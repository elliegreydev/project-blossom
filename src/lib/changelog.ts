// Blossom's in-app changelog. Newest entry first.
//
// Every shipped change bumps APP_VERSION and adds an entry here, kept in sync
// with package.json. Same discipline as Filthy Rich Tycoon, different tone:
// Blossom's whole design is quiet by default, so entries are written plainly
// and the popup that shows them never celebrates at someone who might have
// opened the app on a rough day.
//
// Tags colour the bullet:
//   "new"      what wasn't there before
//   "improved" something that already existed, working better
//   "fix"      something that was broken
